# Real-Time-Object-Detection-and-Depth-Estimation-Using-YOLO-and-MiDaS
Description:  This project integrates the YOLOv5 model for real-time object detection and the MiDaS model for depth estimation. Using live video feed, the system detects people and vehicles, calculates their depth, and makes decisions (e.g., “STOP” or “GO”) based on the proximity of detected objects.
